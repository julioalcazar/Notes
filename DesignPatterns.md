___Abstract Factory___  
Intent
*  Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
*  A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction of a suite of "products".
*  The new operator considered harmful.
Problem  
If an application is to be portable, it needs to encapsulate platform dependencies. These "platforms" might include: windowing system, operating system, database, etc. Too often, this encapsulatation is not engineered in advance, and lots of #ifdef case statements with options for all currently supported platforms begin to procreate like rabbits throughout the code.

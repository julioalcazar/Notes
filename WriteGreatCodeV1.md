#Write Great Code Volume I : Understanding the Machine  
  
__Characteristics of Great Code__  
* Uses the CPU efficiently (which means the code is fast)
* Uses memory efficiently (which means the code is small)
* Uses system resources efficiently
* Is easy to read and maintain
* Follows a consistent set of style guidelines
* Uses an explicit design that follows established software engineering conventions
* Is easy to enhance
* Is well-tested and robust (meaning that it works)
* Is well-documented

__C++ Representation of Numbering System__  
* Hexadecimal base by prefixing a "0x" eg: 0xdead 
* Octal base by prefixing a numeric string with a zero eg: 0123 = 83.

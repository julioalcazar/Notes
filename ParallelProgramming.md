Notes for ["Parallel programming"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1)

___What is Parallel Computing?___  
  *  Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations are performed at the same time.  
  *  Basic principle: computation can be divided into smaller subproblems, each of which can be solved simultaneously.  

___Parallelism Granularity___  
Parallelism manifests itself at different granularity levels
  *  bit-level parallelism – processing multiple bits of data in parallel
  *  instruction-level parallelism – executing different instructions from the same instruction stream in parallel
  *  task-level parallelism – executing separate instruction streams in parallel

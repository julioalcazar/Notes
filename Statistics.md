###Mean  
The arithmetic mean of a set of values is the quantity commonly called "the" mean or the average.  
Add all number and divide by count.

###Median  
The median of a statistical distribution with distribution function D(x) is the value x such D(x)=1/2. For a symmetric distribution, it is therefore equal to the mean.  
Sort the array and the number in the middle that is the mean, in case of even count, take the 2 numbers in the middle and add them and divide by 2
Given order statistics Y is sorted, the statistical median of the random sample is defined by

###Mode  
The most common value obtained in a set of observations. For example, for a data set (3, 7, 3, 9, 9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 5), the unique mode is 3. Similarly, for a data set (2, 4, 9, 6, 4, 6, 6, 2, 8, 2), there are two modes: 2 and 6. A distribution with a single mode is said to be unimodal. A distribution with more than one mode is said to be bimodal, trimodal, etc., or in general, multimodal.  

###Weighted Mean
A mean where some values contribute more than others

###Quartile  
The quartiles of an ordered data set are the  points that split the data set into  equal groups. The quartiles are defined as follows:  
*  Q1 : The first quartile is the middle number between the smallest number in a data set and its median.  
*  Q2 : The second quartile is the median (50 percentile) of the data set.  
*  Q3 : The third quartile is the middle number between a data set's median and its largest number.

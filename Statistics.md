###Median  
The median of a statistical distribution with distribution function D(x) is the value x such D(x)=1/2. For a symmetric distribution, it is therefore equal to the mean.  
Sort the array and the number in the middle that is the mean, in case of even count, take the 2 numbers in the middle and add them and divide by 2
Given order statistics Y is sorted, the statistical median of the random sample is defined by

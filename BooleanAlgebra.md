#Boolean Algebra  

__Operations with 0 and 1__  
X OR 0 = X  
X OR 1 = 1  
X AND 1 = X  
X AND 0 = 0  

__Idempotent laws__  
X OR X = X  
X AND X = X  

__Involution law__  
NOT(NOT(X)) = X  

__Laws of complementarity__  
X OR NOT(X) = 1   
X AND NOT(X) = 0  

__Commutative laws__  
X OR Y = Y OR X  
X AND Y = Y AND X  

__Associative laws__  
(X OR Y) OR Z = X OR (Y OR Z) = X OR Y OR Z  
(X AND Y) AND Z = X AND(Y AND Z) = X AND Y AND Z  

__Distributive laws__  
X AND ( Y OR Z ) = (X AND Y) OR (X AND Z)  
X OR Y AND Z = ( X OR Y ) AND ( X OR Z )  

__Simplification theorems__  
(X AND Y) OR (X AND NOT(Y)) = X  
(X OR Y) AND (X OR NOT(Y)) = X  
X OR (X AND Y) = X  
X AND ( X OR Y ) = X  
(X OR NOT(Y)) AND Y = X AND Y  
X AND NOT(Y) OR Y = X OR Y  

__DeMorgan’s laws__  
NOT(X OR Y OR Z + … ) = NOT(X) AND NOT(Y) AND NOT(Z) …  
NOT(X AND Y AND Z …) = NOT(X) + NOT(Y) + NOT(Z) + …  

__Theorem for multiplying out and factoring__  
(X OR Y) ( NOT(X) OR Z ) = X AND Z OR NOT(X) AND Y

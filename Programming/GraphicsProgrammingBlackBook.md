### Rules for Building High-Performance Code  
Rules for creating high-performance software:  
  * Know where you're going (understand the objective of the software).  
  * Make a big map (have an overall program design firmly in mind, so the various parts of the program and the data structures work well together).  
  * Make lots of little maps (design an algorithm for each separate part of the overall design).  
  * Know the territory (understand exactly how the computer carries out each task).  
  * Know when it matters (identify the portions of your programs where performance matters, and don't waste your time optimizing the rest).  
  * Always consider the alternatives (don't get stuck on a single approach; odds are there's a better way, if you're clever and inventive enough).  
  * Know how to turn on the juice (optimize the code as best you know how when it *does* matter).

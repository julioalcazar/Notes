Notes for ["Mastering the Software Engineering Interview"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview/)

__Technical Questions__  
*  Fully discuss your solution(s) with the interviewer (without codding).  
*  Listening to the interviewer is critical.  
*  Presentation can impact credibility.  

---  

__Technical Phone Screen or Interview__
Introduction followed by questions on:  
 1. Programming (often in a shared doc)  
 2. Data Structures / Big-O  
 3. Object Oriented Principles  
 4. Other CS Topics (Bitwise manipulation, Scripting, Proper use of Libraries, Testing)  

---  

__Practical Tips__ 
*  Solid internet/phone connection + backup plan  
	*  Have Google Hang-out/ Skype Account  
	*  Look at camera, not yourself  
*  Big expressions (e.g. careful about quick nods)  
*  TEST EVERYTHING before the interview  
	*  Get a friend to call you/etc.  
*  If non-visual, it's okay to have notes  
	*  But don't rely too heavily on them…  
*  Take notes  
	*  With whom did you interview, etc.  
*  Find a way to relax beforehand  
*  Be practised and prepared!  

---  

__Common Pitfalls__  
*  Not talking!  
*  Not ensuring a 2-way dialogue  
*  Not being prepared  
*  Resume errors  

---  

__In Person Interview Format__  
*  About 45 Minutes with Software Engineer  
*  Introduction followed by questions on:  
	*  Programming (whiteboard)  
	*  Data Structures / Big-O  
	*  Building Complex Algorithms  
	*  Other CS Topics (Bitwise manipulation, Logic Problems, System design, Testing)  

---  

__How to Succeed In Person Interview__  
*  It's OK to question your interviewer.
*  When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it.
*  If you don't understand - ask for help or clarification.
*  If you need to assume something - verbally check it’s a correct assumption!
*  Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.
*  Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as he/she will be as interested in your process of thought as your solution.
*  Also, if you're stuck, they may provide hints if they know what you're doing.
*  Finally, listen - don't miss a hint if your interviewer is trying to assist you!

---  

__Why are they asking you to Introduce Yourself?__  
*  Reassurance of your background  
*  Spark conversation  
*  See what you think is important  

---  

__Introduce Yourself Template__  
*  Who are you?  
*  What's your background?  
*  What's a recent accomplishment which fits this position?  
*  Additional Criteria  
	*  Organized and Brief  
	*  Conveys confidence  
	*  Professional demeanor  
	*  Appropriate for the position  

---  

__Live coding__  
*  Pitfalls
	*  Unconfirmed assumptions
	*  Lack of communication
	*  Missed errors and failure to correct them
	*  Lack of follow-through and analysis
*  Talking through the Processes

---  

__Unconfirmed Assumptions__  
*  When given a problem, start by talking thought potential issues and asking clarifying questions
	*  Ask Questions to help confirm your understanding of the task at hand
	*  Ask Key questions ( is the input a float? is the input negative? etc.... )
	*  Ask about corner cases 

---  

__Find and Recover from Mistakes__  
*  Trace what's actually written  
*  Acknowledge the mistake, but don't get flustered  
*  Mistakes
	*  Not tracing code
	*  Missing a hint
*  Tracing code helps to
	*  catch bugs
	*  consider edge cases
	*  demonstrate thought process and work-flow to interviewer

---  

__Good Phone Interview__  
*  Restate you problem in a a code comment from
*  Ask about error handling 
*  Show function input and output
*  Check with interviewer if you could use built in functions.
*  When done codding test and show variable values in a comment from

---  

__Personal Interview__  
*  Tell me about a project you worked on?
	*  Show that you can solve problems
	*  Show your communications skills
	*  Use STAR method (Situation, Task Action, Result)

---  

__STAR__  
*  Start with the problem (problem = reason for listener to care)
	*  High level description  
	*  Lower level description (more technical)  
*  Pitfall 
	*  Getting to the solution too quickly (Interviewer doesn't understand the problem your trying to solve)  
	*  Not listening for interviewer/questions.  
	*  Your talk should be understandable to audience, Don't talk technical with non-technical people  
		*  Practice with different level of technical background  
		*  Ask if the want more details or technical information  

---  

__Interacting with Audience__  
*  Use clear language  
*  Not overly technical  
*  Don't want solution to sound complicated
*  Keep is simple and elegant  
*  Make use of visual aids (make use of a whiteboard to explain your previous project)

---  

__Communication Skills__   
*  Make eye contact
	*  Read your audience and adjust
	*  Don’t leave your audience behind
	*  Be excited!
	*  Practice

---  

__Responding to your Audience__  
*  If interview asks a question don’t shut him down (he should not feel his question was stupid)
*  If they are asking questions that means they are interested in your work
*  Acknowledge the person asking the question
*  Be sure you understand the question
*  Refer to your previous work
*  Make sure you answered the question

---  

__Describing a group project__  
*  Talk about challenges you face as part of team?
	*  High light challenger and how you solved them
	*  Show group work
	*  Practice

---  

__Algorithmic Problem Solving__  
*  Ask questions
	*  Brainstorm in the context of a special case
	*  Discover potential obstacles
	*  Hightlight additional assumptions and constraints
*  Always provide a brute-force solution (it should not be smart or elegent just a correct solution)  
	*  You don't have to implemented unless asked 
	*  Test with normal input 
	*  Test with edge cases
	*  what Data Structures will be used
	*  what is the performance
	*  what is the trade-offs
*  Now iterate this process with a more elegant solution
*  Do a high level design
	*  Listen to interviewer hints
	*  Only write code if you are confident of your solution.

---  

__Algorithmic Problem Solving Hints__  
*  When dealing with numbers 
	*  Ask if there is negative number?
	*  What does the numbers represent? Age? Size? 
	*  Is the number int, float double? (Will it fit in int, float, etc.?)
	*  Is there a number range? (1 to N ?)
	*  Are number unique or duplicate?
	*  Are they pre-sorted?
	*  can we modify the container (array)?
*  Work thought some examples
*  Work thought some examples with strange behavior

---  

__Working on the Whiteboard__  
*  Start with function definition (function inputs and outputs)
*  write some code to validate your input
*  Method name should be meaningful 
*  Keep space between lines so you can change code later or add code in between lines later
*  Trace thought your code with an example
*  You can use a one letter to represent a variable (tell interviewer that it you would use a better name but ur using one letter for favour of time) 
*  try no to use i and j for variables (they look similar or they could be mistaken for ;) use K, M etc
*  Write big enough

---  

__Interviewer Evaluation criteria__  
*  Listening carefully?
*  Can you understand what is given to you?  
*  Comprehending questions?   
*  Asking correct questions?
*  Any unchecked assumptions?
*  Hearing and heeding hints?
*  Finding multiple solutions before choosing the best one?
*  Seeking new ideas and methods?
*  Inventing and flexible?
*  Open to new ideas?
*  Can questions move up to more complex problem solving?

__7 Steps to Solve Algorithms Problems__  
1. Listen  
2. Add more example (no special cases)  
3. State a Brute force algorithm (you don’t have to code it)  
4. Optimize  
5. Walk thought your algorithm (Know exactly what you’re going to do before coding, what variables, what data structure).  
6. Start coding (code style matters) 
7. Test (small test case, edge test case, large test case)

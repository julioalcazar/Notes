__How to Succeed In Person Interview__  
*  It's OK to question your interviewer.
*  When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it.
*  If you don't understand - ask for help or clarification.
*  If you need to assume something - verbally check its a correct assumption!
*  Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.
*  Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as he/she will be as interested in your process of thought as your solution.
*  Also, if you're stuck, they may provide hints if they know what you're doing.
*  Finally, listen - don't miss a hint if your interviewer is trying to assist you!

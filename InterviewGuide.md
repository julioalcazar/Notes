__Technical Questions__  
*  Fully discuss your solution(s) with the interviewer (without codding).  
*  Listening to the interviewer is critical.  
*  Presentation can impact credibility.  

---  

__Technical Phone Screen or Interview__
Introduction followed by questions on:  
 1. Programming (often in a shared doc)  
 2. Data Structures / Big-O  
 3. Object Oriented Principles  
 4. Other CS Topics (Bitwise manipulation, Scripting, Proper use of Libraries, Testing)  

---  

__Practical Tips__ 
*  Solid internet/phone connection + backup plan  
	*  Have Google Hang-out/ Skype Account  
	*  Look at camera, not yourself  
*  Big expressions (e.g. careful about quick nods)  
*  TEST EVERYTHING before the interview  
	*  Get a friend to call you/etc.

*  Not talking!  
*  Not ensuring a 2-way dialogue  
*  Not being prepared  
*  Resume errors  

---  

__In Person Interview Format__  
*  About 45 Minutes with Software Engineer  
*  Introduction followed by questions on:  
	*  Programming (whiteboard)  
	*  Data Structures / Big-O  
	*  Building Complex Algorithms  
	*  Other CS Topics (Bitwise manipulation, Logic Problems, System design, Testing)

__How to Succeed In Person Interview__  
*  It's OK to question your interviewer.
*  When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it.
*  If you don't understand - ask for help or clarification.
*  If you need to assume something - verbally check its a correct assumption!
*  Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.
*  Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking as he/she will be as interested in your process of thought as your solution.
*  Also, if you're stuck, they may provide hints if they know what you're doing.
*  Finally, listen - don't miss a hint if your interviewer is trying to assist you!

__Why are they asking you to Introduce Yourself?__

*  Additional Criteria  
	*  Organized and Brief

---  

__Live coding__  
*  Pitfalls
	*  Unconfirmed assumptions
	*  Lack of communication
	*  Missed errors and failure to correct them
	*  Lack of follow-through and analysis
*  Talking through the Processes

---  

__Unconfirmed Assumptions__  
*  When given a problem, start by talking thought potential issues and asking clarifying questions
	*  Ask Questions to help confirm your understanding of the task at hand
	*  Ask Key questions ( is the input a float? is the input negative? etc.... )
	*  Ask about corner cases 

---  

__Find and Recover from Mistakes__  
*  Trace what's actually written  
*  Acknowledge the mistake, but don't get flustered  
*  Mistakes
	*  Not tracing code
	*  Missing a hint
*  Tracing code helps to
	*  catch bugs
	*  consider edge cases
	*  demonstrate thought process and work-flow to interviewer

---  

__Good Phone Interview__  
*  Restate you problem in a a code comment from
*  Ask about error handling 
*  Show function input and output
*  Check with interviewer if you could use built in functions.
*  When done codding test and show variable values in a comment from

---  

__Personal Interview__  
*  Tell me about a project you worked on?
	*  Show that you can solve problems
	*  Show your communications skills
	*  Use STAR method (Situation, Task Action, Result)

---  

__STAR__  
*  Start with the problem (problem = reason for listener to care)
	*  High level description  
	*  Lower level description (more technical)  
*  Pitfall 
	*  Getting to the solution too quickly (Interviewer doesn't understand the problem your trying to solve)  
	*  Not listening for interviewer/questions.  
	*  Your talk should be understandable to audience, Don't talk technical with non-technical people

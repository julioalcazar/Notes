# Cloud Computing Concepts

* A single-site cloud (aka "datacenter") consists of
    * Compute nodes (grouped into racks)
    * Switches, connecting the racks
    * A network topology, e.g., hierarchical
    * Storage (backend) nodes connected to the network
    * Front-end for submitting jobs and receiving client requests
    * Software services

* A geographically distributed cloud consists of
    * Multiple such sites
    * Each site perhaps with a different structure and services

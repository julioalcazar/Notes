___Algebraic properties___  

| Property          | Note 1           |Note 2    |  
|:----------------- |:---------------- |:-------- |  
| Reflexive         | a = a            |          |  
| Additive Identity | a + 0 = a        |          |  
| Additive Inverse  | a + (-a) = 0     |          |  
| Definition of Subtraction | a - b = a + (-b) | |  
| Multiplicative Identity | a * 1 = a | |  
| Multiplicative Inverse | a * (1/a) = 1 if (a != 0) | |  
| Multiplication times 0 | a * 0 = 0 | |  
| Definition of Division | a / b = a(1/b) | |   
| Commutative       | a + b = b + a    | ab = ba  |  
| Associative       | (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) | (ab)c = a(bc) | |  
| Distributive      | a (b + c) = ab + ac | (b + c)a = ba + ca | |  
| Transitive        | If a = b and b = c then a = c | |  
| Symmetric        | If a = b then b = a | |

___Parentheses, Brackets and Braces___  
**()** Parentheses  
**[]** Square brackets  
**{}** Braces  
**<>** Angle brackets

___Rational Numbers (fractions)___  
Rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers.  
numerators/denominators  
  
__Add/Subtract fractions__  
Step 1: Make sure the bottom numbers (the denominators) are the same.  
Step 2: Add/Subtract the top numbers (the numerators), put the answer over the denominator  
Step 3: Simplify the fraction (if needed)  

__Divide Fractions__  
Step 1. Turn the second fraction (the one you want to divide by) upside down (this is now a reciprocal).  
Step 2. Multiply the first fraction by that reciprocal  
Step 3. Simplify the fraction (if needed)  

__Mixed Number to Improper Fraction__  
eg: 3 5/9  
Step 1. Multiply the denominator by the whole number 9 Ã— 3 = 27  
Step 2. Add the answer from Step 1 to the numerator 27 + 5 = 32  
Step 3. Write answer from Step 2 over the denominator 32/9  

__Polynomials__  
polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients which only employs the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.  
Polynomial comes from poly- (meaning "many") and -nomial (in this case meaning "term")... so it says "many terms".

__Rational Expressions__  
A rational expression is nothing more than a fraction in which the numerator and/or the denominator are polynomials.
